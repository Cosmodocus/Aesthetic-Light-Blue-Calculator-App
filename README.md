# Aesthetic-Light-Blue-Calculator-App

##Overview
I created this calculator using html, css, and javascript

I learnt lots of properties, methods, and ways to design such as:
  - eval()   //sidenote: use it less for security purposes
  - .slice()
  - onclick
  - .display
  - .value

##LearningJourney
This was one of my successful projects that I created using html, css, and javascript, as I had only been using html and css prior. I loved playing with the design. The design was inspired by the current time of creating the project, which was December(winter). 

#FuturePlans
May return to add more advanced math operators and functions, or to change the design.

Please feel free to update or edit as you please.
